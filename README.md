## Description

Please develop a simple chat with following requirements:

 -  I should be able to enter my name(only once - after, you can store it in cache).
 -  Should have 3 independent rooms(messages should be arrived at the relevant rooms
only).
 -  For each room i want to see the list of participants
 -  Client side should be developed on react.
 -  Server side should be developed on asp.net core(preference to use WS/SignalR)

Notes:
 -  Donâ€™t spend too much time on UI/UX(nice to have but not critical).
 -  All messages and users should be stored in memory.
 -  I should be able to open two different tabs(regular and incognito and chat between
them)
